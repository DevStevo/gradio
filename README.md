## Gradio is not dead!

### What I can expect from Gradio 6.0?

* A new discover page!

* An easier selection mode!

* A shiny new settings page, which is a bit more informative!

* And much more!

### Known bugs 
* HUGE ram usage (normal use +700MB). Related with gdk.pixbuf. 

The 6.0 branch gets every day more and more usable. But still not usable enough for master...


**Everything you can see here, is WIP! Feel free to test the gradio_6 branch, but expect unfinished features and many bugs! Everything is actually WIP**

I know the current development is a bit slow, but I'm a bit busy the last days...
